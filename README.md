# 🚀 _Day 2. Find H-Index_ 🧠

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/sorting-gfg-160/problem/find-h-index--165609)  

## 💡 **Problem Description:**

You are given an array of integers `citations[]`, where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for the `i-th` paper. Your task is to find the H-Index of the researcher.  

H-Index is the largest value `H` such that the researcher has at least `H` papers that have been cited at least `H` times.

## 🔍 **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:**  
`citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]`  
**Output:**  
`3`  

**Explanation:**  
There are at least 3 papers (with 3, 5, and 3 citations) that have been cited at least 3 times.  



**Input:**  
`citations[] = [5, 1, 2, 4, 1]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  

**Explanation:**  
There are at least 2 papers (with 5 and 4 citations) that have been cited at least 2 times.  



**Input:**  
`citations[] = [0, 0]`  
**Output:**  
`0`  

**Explanation:**  
No paper has been cited at least once.



### Constraints:
- $`1 ≤ citations.size() ≤ 10^6`$
- $`0 ≤ citations[i] ≤ 10^6`$



## 🎯 **My Approach:**

1. **Bucket Sort Method:**  
   - We create an array `buckets[]` where `buckets[i]` stores the count of papers with exactly `i` citations.
   - If a paper has citations greater than or equal to the number of papers, it is counted in a special `buckets[n]`.
   - After building the bucket, we compute the cumulative count of papers with at least `i` citations to determine the H-Index.

2. **Steps:**  
   - Traverse the `citations[]` array to populate the `buckets[]`.  
   - Traverse the `buckets[]` array from the back to compute the cumulative counts and find the H-Index.  
   - This approach ensures a linear time complexity.  



## 🕒 **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity** 

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the size of the `citations` array. We perform one traversal to populate the `buckets[]` and another traversal to compute the H-Index.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(n), as we use an array of size `n+1` for the bucket sort.


## 📝 **Solution Code**
## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        n = len(citations)
        buckets = [0] * (n + 1)

        for c in citations:
            if c >= n:
                buckets[n] += 1
            else:
                buckets[c] += 1

        cumulative = 0
        for i in range(n, -1, -1):
            cumulative += buckets[i]
            if cumulative >= i:
                return i
        return 0
```
